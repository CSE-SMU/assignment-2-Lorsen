# Assignment 2 Postmortem

## How difficult was this assignment?

It was a big jump from the first assignment, for sure.
This was definitely doable, though. I don't think I completed it 
exactly like you have wanted, but I was able to make a face which 
was definitely a challenge.

## Did you learn anything new from this assignment?

I feel like I learned quite a bit.

Pseudo elements.
Absolute vs Relative positioning(although I feel like I still don't have it down yet).
Class selectors.
Border-radius.
I feel like I have more knowledge of the DOM and Box Model.
I realize that it takes a lot of practice to be any good at this.

## Did you use any of the links provided in the homework? If so, which ones?

I used the links on how to center vertically, how to make the triangle in the hair, the wikipedia link, and Krasimir's blog.
I think that was all of them. I also found a page on how to create shapes which I used for my "shirt".

## How could this assignment be improved?

Perhaps show common mistakes people might make? The instructions made sense once I researched or played around 
with the properties.  I did feel like I didn't know what I was doing when I first started.

## Any other comments?

I know that you are trying to encourage us to use the discussion board. Perhaps link to it on the assignment page?
Maybe mention that certain questions can only be answered on the board? (like that bullet question)

I feel that we may be going fast in the lectures, especially with some of the coding examples.

I know that people around me who are trying to follow end up stopping because we are lines behind you or 
you have moved on to a new topic/example.
